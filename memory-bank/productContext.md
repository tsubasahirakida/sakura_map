# Product Context: Sakura Map

## Market Background

### Virtual Experiences Trend
The demand for virtual experiences has grown significantly, especially after global events that limited physical gatherings. People seek alternative ways to enjoy cultural traditions and seasonal events when they cannot participate in person.

### Digital Hanami
Cherry blossom viewing (hanami) is a beloved tradition in Japan, attracting both locals and tourists. However, not everyone can physically attend due to:
- Geographic limitations (living far from cherry blossom locations)
- Time constraints
- Health or mobility issues
- Travel restrictions
- Weather conditions affecting bloom periods

### Similar Products
- Virtual tourism applications
- Interactive maps with seasonal information
- Social virtual worlds
- Casual games with seasonal themes

However, few solutions specifically focus on the cultural experience of hanami with real-time data and social elements.
